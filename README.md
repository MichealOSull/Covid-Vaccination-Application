# Covid-Vaccination-Application
Java program for the use of maintaining a vaccine rollout system. Included Clients, FullVaccination(due to double and single jabs) and ClientCollections for which a particular client got a particular vaccine 
and its location. A GUI was created using JavaFX to allow for a user interface and for user input. MVC structure was used to seperate each components. User input such as
the name of clients, vaccine names, location and dates were stored in a databse using JPA Persistence. An appropriate schema was created within MySQL and the data was stored
in specific tables within the schema.
